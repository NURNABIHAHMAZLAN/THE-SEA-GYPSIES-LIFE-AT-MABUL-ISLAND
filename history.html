           <th><h2 id = "history">HISTORY OF MABUL ISLAND </h2><p>Previously, Mabul Island was only filled with fishing villages, 
             the houses of the Pala-u (sea nomads-sea gypsies) and Filipino war refugees. The majority of the residents here are of Suluk and Bajau descent. 
             Due to ‘fish-bomb’ activities and severe pollution by cyanide & dynamite since the 70s, the sea floor of Mabul Island has changed drastically and there are various types of odd living species inhabiting dead sea corals,
             rubbish and under rock piles- Concrete.</p><p>Mabul Island was occupied in the early 1970s. Coconut plantations are cultivated by Mabul landowners who come from Menampilik Island. 
             The seabed of Mabul Island consists of various depths. The base facing Semporna is a shallow sea platform, which is between 2-20 meters while the base facing Sipadan Island is a deep sea gap of more than 800 meters. 
             The landowners of this island are not aware of the potential of the seabed of Mabul Island as a world -class diving destination.</p><p>In 1999, Mabul Island had a population of 2,034 people. This number often fluctuates because some residents commute to the Philippines or migrate to other places in Sabah. 
             The majority of the population is foreign immigrants from a small island group in the southern Philippines. For security purposes, the island is under the control of the General Grakan Police Force. More than half of the population (50.7 percent) is 14 years old and under. 
             There are two main tribes, namely Suluk and Bajau. The majority are Muslims. The average population received education at the primary level only, that is when in the Philippines before. There are two villages, namely Kampung Mabul and Kampung Musu.
            </p><p>However, the population depends on the sea for their livelihood. 
             They catch fish, make boats and fishing gear and raise agar-agar. They use popular fishing methods in the Philippines,
             namely brackish and sangkaliya. The island's fishermen catch fish in the deep sea near the Malaysia-Philippines international match within three to five days. 
             The catch is sold in Semporna. The island is equipped with a mosque, school, fishing hall and electricity supply. The trail connects the village with the tourist center from the mainland to the island.
            </p><p>In 2005, after Sipadan Island was gazetted as a National Park, 
             all buildings and resorts were ordered to be relocated to Mabul Island by the authorities. 
             Starting after that, Mabul Island became famous for two reasons; firstly it becomes the only island that houses over 20 resorts adjacent to Sipadan Island and 
             secondly; because of the odd animals that are under its sea surface so much so that it earned the nickname ‘The Best MUCK-diving Site Of The World’.
